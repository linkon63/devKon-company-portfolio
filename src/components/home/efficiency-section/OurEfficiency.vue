                    platform, which they would offer to local restaurants and delivery
                    persons in a region as a third-party platform for getting the food to
                    the doorstep of the customer. The customer would use the platform to
                    find the nearest restaurants and get their food delivered to their
                    destinations."

                    businesses within the transportation domain, connecting the dots between
                    service providers and the consumers. The company does not directly
                    employ any individual offering delivery service; it just provides the
